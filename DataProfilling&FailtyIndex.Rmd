When exploring missing data, it is important to address the reason of missingness. Except for deficits of pain whilst walking, missingness of the others can be assumed missing completed at random (MCAR), because the percentage of missing value is not large, ignorance of the missingness should not affect the analysis result with bias. However, the missingness of "pain whilst walking" is special, it is related to other variables, such as the participants being unable to walk, therefore this variable is not applicable, this is been measure in other deficits, in this case, the missingness is still considered ignorable and missing at random (MAR).As a result, participants having missing data is deleted and not including in the sample, which means 78.2\% eligible participants are included in the study.

Put the annotation on variables
```{r}
load("mydata.Rda")
item_an=read.xlsx("deficits ano.xlsx")
for (i in 1:62){
   attr(mydata[,i+1],"label")=item_an[i,2]
}
```

Calculate frailty score for each person -- The frailty index

The frailty index (FI) consisted of 62 deficits, including 10 mobility difficulty deficits, 13 disability deficits, 16 physician diagnosed diseases, eyesight and hearing, self-rated general health, 4 movement deficits, 8 CES-D depression items and 8 cognitive function items.

It is a gamma distribution, which is proved using a goodness of fit test with p-value $< 0.01$. 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
frailty_score=apply(mydata[2:63],1,mean)
print(summary(frailty_score))
hist(frailty_score,freq=F,breaks = 100)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(goftest)



den=density(frailty_score)
dat <- data.frame(x = den$x, y = den$y)
fit.params= fitdistr(frailty_score,"gamma",lower=c(0,0)) #fit gamma distribution
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = x,y = y)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +     
  geom_line(aes(x=dat$x, y=dgamma(dat$x,fit.params$estimate["shape"], fit.params$estimate["rate"])), color="red", size = 1) + 
  theme_classic()
ggplot(data = dat) +
  geom_histogram(data = as.data.frame(frailty_score), aes(x=frailty_score, y=..density..),bins = 50,fill="blue",color="black") +
  geom_line(aes(x=dat$x, y=dgamma(dat$x,fit.params$estimate["shape"], fit.params$estimate["rate"])), color="red", size = 1) + 
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x="Frailty Index",y="Density")

summary(frailty_score)
sd(frailty_score)

# The scale and shape of "gamma" districution
scale=sd(frailty_score)^2/mean(frailty_score)
shape=mean(frailty_score)^2/sd(frailty_score)^2
